They are facing issues like tracking:
1) length of calls

4) Total number of calls attended and abonded

My steps in tackling this issue through data analysis:
Created a dashboard in Power Bi for visualizing relevant KPI's and metrics in the dataset provided.
Utilized the resources provided, including poscasts and articles, to enhance your understanding of data visuallization and upskilling.
Respond to the cllient's request by providing a well-designed Power BI dashboard reflecting the requested KPI's.
